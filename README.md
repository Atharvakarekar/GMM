# GMM

GMM represents the data distribution as a weighted sum of K Gaussian components, each characterized by its mean, covariance, and weight. These components capture different clusters or modes in the data, allowing GMM to model complex patterns.

Parameter Estimation:
The key task in GMM is estimating the parameters of the Gaussian components. This is typically done using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which iteratively optimizes the likelihood function. In the E-step, the algorithm estimates the probabilities of data points belonging to each Gaussian component, while in the M-step, it updates the parameters based on these probabilities.

Advantages of Gaussian Mixture Models:

Flexible Modeling: GMMs can capture complex data distributions by representing them as a combination of Gaussian components.
Soft Clustering: Unlike hard clustering algorithms, GMM provides soft assignments, indicating the probability of each data point belonging to different clusters.
Density Estimation: GMM can estimate the underlying probability density function of the data, allowing for generation of new data samples.
Robustness to Outliers: GMM is less sensitive to outliers compared to some other clustering algorithms.
Use Cases:
Gaussian Mixture Models find applications in various domains, including:

Clustering: GMM can effectively cluster data points into different groups based on their underlying distribution.
Anomaly Detection: GMM can identify outliers by estimating the likelihood of data points based on the learned Gaussian mixture model.
Image Segmentation: GMM can separate different objects or regions in an image based on their pixel intensities.
Speech Recognition: GMMs have been used in modeling phonemes and acoustic features for speech recognition systems.
